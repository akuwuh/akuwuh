# ðŸ“¦ Scripts Moved to Re-Po

This directory previously contained the `lang-stats` package. 

## ðŸšš New Location

All code has been migrated to: **[akuwuh/re-po](https://github.com/akuwuh/re-po)**

```
akuwuh/re-po/packages/py-core/
â”œâ”€â”€ lang_stats/          # Main package (DDD architecture)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                # All documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ generate_langs.py    # Main script
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml
```

## ðŸ”„ Migration Details

The migration preserved full git history using `git-filter-repo`. The code now lives in a dedicated repository for better organization and reusability.
